 ## /graphql
The **graphql** repo is the GraphQL API. It's built on Node & written in JavaScript.

GraphQL was chosen because it has a great interface for selecting specific sets of data and works very well with the React-based user interface. GraphQL also supports using another data source ( eg. REST ) as a backend source of information. In our use case, JSON-RPC is being queried and relayed behind the scenes. There is also caching done for optimized initial loads of the website.

It serves the following roles:
 - *read/view* operations to fetch objects stored in the blockchain
 - supplies the current state of the data store to users on the website
